	  <p> I play 4 instruments, including piano, trumpet, violin and guitar. Guitar is my favorite, and I currently own 3 of them.
	  Writting music is a great outlet for expression, and the best part about it is that when writting lyrics, they can have
           different meanings to different people. I find that having backround experience in music makes it easier to come up with
	       melodies and rythms for a song. Some of my favorite artists/bands are Radiohead, Alex G, The Smashing Pumpkins, 
		  The Coceteau Twins. Their music has so music has so much variety and have inspired me to write my own songs. </p>
